This is an entity component system framework for writing games. It is written in dart because it is for writing stuff in the browser. I didn't really like how Java-y the dart port of Artemis is, so I decided to write my own. There is another one written in dart, but it isn't exactly what I have in mind for an ecs. Maybe their way is better, but in particular I prefer entities to be actual objects rather than ints. This probably makes things harder in some ways (networked games come to mind), but it is conceptually simpler. If it turns out to be slow I'll rewrite it.
